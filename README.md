### Summary

After reviewing the temperature data for Oahu, it was brought to our attention that also rain plays an important factor to our customer in his decision to buy or not in our future business, because of this it was assessed how does the precipitations affect our location in the month of June and December. One of the considerations used is that a precipitation lower than 0.15" might be considered negligble. Below are two Data Frames that show the statistics of precipitation for both months.
